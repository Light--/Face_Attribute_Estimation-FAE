# PYTORCH GLASS DETECTOR USING TRANSFER LEARNING.

### Used Pytorch to train and validate the model, check "./src/glass_classifier_training.ipynb".

### Resnet-18 pretrained model from pytorch was as feature extractor which can be easily replaced.

### Used celeba dataset with ~13k(with glasses) and ~13k (without glasses) as dataset. 

### Resnet-18 can easily manage the task at hand and the pretrained model is available in model directory.

### Use "./src/glass_inference.ipynb" for Inference code on your webcam.
